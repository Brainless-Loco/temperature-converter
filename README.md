I was trying to learn about Javascript for few days. But I didn't try to write JS codes and do something with that.
Recently I found a guy on Youtube named Tyler Potts and his one of tutorials on Temperature converter. I liked that video [as that was a short video with less complexity :p] so much that I intented to do this.
So Finally I did with and I also modified some css version as my wish.


The Video Tutorial Link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWoGu5tSeig&list=PLR8vUZDE6IeN2nqa6d0ezPNPcPrcOufCR&index=1

My Github Page for this project: https://brainless-loco.github.io/temperature-converter/

Let me know if I can improve on it in any way or if you have any suggestion for me to learn Javascript.
